1. Install Visual Studio 2022
2. Install MySQL Server 9.2.0. The username and password I have used are as follows but you can specify your own and enter them in step 5:
	2.1 Username: root
	2.2 Password: ijn^9ThQXha3&
3. Install MySQL Workbench (will be used to run a MySQL query to setup the DB environment)
4. In my GitHub repository, open the "Setup" folder, copy the contents of "MySQL_DB_Setup"
	4.1 Open MySQL Workbench, connect to the MySQL Server you have installed on your machine
	4.2 Open a new query tab and paste the contents of "MySQL_DB_Setup" file mentioned in step 4
	4.3 Execute the query to CREATE "AllTheBeans" database, CREATE four tables and INSERT data into the appropriate tables
5. Open my Bean_API solution in Visual Studio 2022 and ensure your "appsettings.json" file has the correct login credentials for your MySQL Server
6. There is authentication setup on the CoffeeBean endpoints. To disable this in order to test all endpoints on Swagger, do the following, otherwise continue to step 7:
	6.1 Disable the authentication by commenting out the "[Authorize]" (line 8) in "CoffeeBeanController.cs". This will allow you to test everything in Swagger
	6.2 Run Bean_API in Visual Studio 2022
7. To test the API with Authentication enabled:
	7.1 Run Bean_API in Visual Studio 2022
	7.2 Invoke "/Auth/Login" endpoint to generate a JWT token
	7.3 Using a third party API testing tool like Postman, you can provide the JWT token you just generated by clicking the "Authorization" tab -> Choose "Bearer Token" in the drop down -> enter the JWT token in the "Token" text field
	7.4 Invoke an endpoint in the API by choosing: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE from the top drop down and enter the appropriate URL. 
    7.4.1 For example, to get all Coffee Beans -> Choose "GET" -> Enter the API URL (change the local host ID in this example appropriately) http://localhost:5297/CoffeeBean -> Ensure you have setup the JWT token (step 7.3) -> Click "Send"
